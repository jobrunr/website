## JobRunr in the news!
This is a small update on how JobRunr is mentioned in the media and how it is used on day to day basis in various projects.

### Thank you Thoughtworks!

### AxonFramework
Over the last week we also had contact with the developers from [AxonIQ](https://www.axoniq.io/) - the creators of [AxonFramework](https://github.com/AxonFramework). They decided to use JobRunr as a replacement for Quartz Scheduler inside AxonFramework. 
We're looking forward to a fruitful collaboration.

### CoffeeJug
JobRunr was featured in [CoffeeJug](https://www.coffeejug.org/) by [Oleh Melnyk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleh-melnyk/) who is working at [Jappware](https://www.jappware.com/). Although none of us speak Ukrainian, we do think they like it 😃.
