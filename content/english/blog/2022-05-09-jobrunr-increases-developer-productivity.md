A customer recently told us something that stopped us in our tracks: their developers saw a **20% increase in productivity** after switching to JobRunr Pro. Not from faster job processing. Not from better APIs. From fewer interruptions.

> "Thanks to the JobRunr Pro Dashboard, our developers had fewer interruptions from first line support."

That's a productivity gain most teams don't even think to measure.

## The Hidden Cost of Support Interruptions

Every software team has support tiers. First line support handles common customer issues. When they can't solve something, they escalate to second line—usually the developers who built the system. Complex issues sometimes reach third line support for specialized help.

The problem? Developers context-switch constantly. A single "quick question" from support can cost 15-30 minutes of focused work. Multiply that by several interruptions per day, and you're losing hours of productive development time every week.

## How One Team Fixed This

This particular customer did something smart: they gave first line support direct access to the [JobRunr Pro Dashboard](/en/documentation/pro/jobrunr-pro-dashboard/).

</figure>

They also established a simple convention: include the customer name in every job name. Now when a customer reports an issue, support can:

1. Search for jobs by customer name
2. See if the job succeeded or failed
3. Check the error details if it failed
4. Requeue the job with one click

Most issues get resolved without ever pinging a developer.

## Why This Works

The dashboard isn't just for developers. It's designed so anyone on your team can use it:

- **Search and filter** to find specific jobs instantly
- **Clear status indicators** show what succeeded, failed, or is still processing
- **One-click retry** for failed jobs—no code changes needed
- **Batch operations** to requeue multiple failed jobs at once

For internal applications, the benefits are just as real. Developers can quickly find their own jobs, troubleshoot issues, and bulk-retry failures without writing custom queries.

> "We could have continued to fiddle around with our own internal task processing... but this is so much cleaner and easier. It's one less thing my team and I have to worry about."
> **— Brent Young, Director of Engineering**

## The Real Win

When support teams can self-serve, developers get something priceless: uninterrupted time to build features.

JobRunr Pro customers consistently report the same pattern:
- Support resolves more issues independently
- Developers spend less time answering "what happened to job X?"
- Teams ship faster because they're not constantly context-switching

> **— Brent Young, Director of Engineering at Prophia**

## Try It Yourself

If your developers are drowning in support requests about background jobs, the dashboard might be the fix you didn't know you needed.
