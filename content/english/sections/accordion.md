# FAQ List
list:
  - title: "Why should our team upgrade to JobRunr Pro?"
    description: "JobRunr Pro is for teams that need to save time and scale. You stop building and maintaining fragile internal tools and get features that are ready for production, like priority queues, workflows, and a multicluster dashboard. You save development time and get expert support, so you can focus on building features for your users, not on infrastructure."

  - title: "What do you mean by 'one production cluster' per license?"
    description: "A JobRunr Pro Business license covers one production cluster. We define a cluster as any group of applications, servers, or microservices that all connect to one single JobRunr database in production. This license lets you use JobRunr in unlimited development environments (dev, test, staging) for free. You can also run your application on unlimited servers or nodes. As long as they connect to that one production database, it's all one cluster. For example, all the microservices for your 'Payments System' would be covered by one license if they share a database. If you have a separate 'CRM System' that uses a different production database, you would need a second license. You can read the full details on our [license page](/en/understanding-your-license)."
  - title: "Can I migrate from the OSS version to Pro easily?"
    description: "Yes. It's a simple replacement. Just update your Maven or Gradle dependency, add your license key, and you're done in minutes. We specifically designed this to remove any friction or uncertainty."
  - title: "What frameworks does JobRunr support?"
    description: "JobRunr integrates natively with Spring Boot, Micronaut, and Quarkus. Our @Transactional plugin ensures your jobs are created reliably from within your existing database transactions."
  - title: "Is JobRunr Pro ready for enterprise or regulated environments?"
    description: "Yes. Pro is built for this. It includes features like SSO for dashboard access, audit trails, and support to help you meet your GDPR and HIPAA compliance requirements."
  - title: "How can I convince my manager to buy Pro?"
    description: "We can help. We prepared an email with 5 clear reasons that frame Pro as an investment that saves development time, reduces infrastructure costs, and lowers production risk. [You can find the email template here.](/en/convince-your-boss)"
  - title: "We are a startup or nonprofit. Do you have special pricing?"
    description: "Yes. We offer special plans for startups, freelancers, and nonprofits. We also offer royalty free licenses if you want to redistribute JobRunr. Please reach out to us, and we will find a plan that works for you."
  - title: "We are an existing customer. Does our pricing change?"
    description: "No. Your current pricing is locked in. This is our way of saying thank you for your early support."
