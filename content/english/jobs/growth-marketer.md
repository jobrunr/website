### Company Overview
Located in Leuven, JobRunr is transforming distributed computing and background job processing in Java. With our library, businesses integrate resilient distributed job processing seamlessly into their applications while also adding instant visibility on how their background jobs are doing.

We are a young startup making a real impact in industries like finance, healthcare, and public transportation.

### The Role
We are seeking an all-round growth marketer who loves to experiment. You will be responsible for the entire marketing funnel, from attracting open-source users to converting them into JobRunr Pro customers. 

This role is a mix of technical content creation, community engagement, and data-driven advertising.

#### What You Will Do

*   **Set up Paid Ads Funnels:** You will manage our advertising budget across LinkedIn and Reddit to drive trials and awareness.
*   **Create Organic Content:** You will write engaging posts for LinkedIn, Bluesky, and our technical blog to share updates and developer tips. You can work with Figma to create new visuals using our existing branding templates.
*   **Community Marketing:** You will help manage JobRunr on Reddit and other developer hangouts, answering questions and sharing our journey.
*   **Execute ABM Campaigns:** You will run creative Account-Based Marketing experiments, such as sending personalized letters to high-intent leads.
*   **Support Video and Webinars:** You will help coordinate our YouTube content and live webinars to showcase new features like Carbon Aware scheduling. You have basic video-editing skills in Adobe Premiere to edit the raw video.
*   **Learn the Tech:** You are not afraid to dive into a bit of Java programming. This helps you speak the same language as our users and write content that truly resonates.

### What We Offer and Ask for
*   The chance to help scale a popular open-source project.
*   A supportive environment where you can test new marketing ideas weekly.
*   Competitive compensation and a central office location in Leuven.
*   Office Attendance: During your first quarter, we require you to be 4 days per week at the office. This allows for rapid learning, team discussion, and brainstorming sessions. Later, this can be relaxed to 2 days per week based on your progress.

### Who We Are Looking For
You are a proactive experienced marketer who enjoys the challenge of technical marketing. 

You have experience with paid social funnels and know how to spark conversations in online communities. You are comfortable looking at data to see what works and what does not.

It is a huge plus if you have an interest in the Java ecosystem or open-source software. You do not need to be an expert coder, but a willingness to learn the basics of Java is essential so you can understand our product and our users.

### Things We Value in Our Team

*   **Drive:** Strive for excellence and go above and beyond to make a mark.
*   **Openness:** Share ideas and feedback openly and respectfully with the team.
*   **Accountability:** Deliver on your promises and take ownership of your projects.
*   **User-centricity:** We prioritize the developers using our product and focus on their productivity.
*   **Flexibility:** Our goals are ambitious, so we remain flexible and evolve based on our learnings.

### Interview Process
*   A small assignment to see how you would approach a JobRunr growth campaign.
*   A conversation to gauge team fit and discuss your past marketing experiments.
