### Company Overview:
Located in Leuven, JobRunr is transforming distributed computing and background job processing in Java. With our library, businesses integrate resilient distributed job processing seamlessly into their applications while also adding instant visibility on how their background jobs are doing.

### The Role:
We're seeking a junior full stack engineer. You will contribute to real-world open-source software and engage in all stages of the development process - including interacting with our great customers.

### What We Offer and Ask for:
- Open-source contribution opportunities - how cool is that 😎.
- Work under the guidance of senior developers.
- Engage across all stages of the development process.
- Uphold code quality and system reliability.
- Supportive environment and competitive compensation.
- **Office Attendance:** During your first quarter, we require you to be **4 days per week** at the office. Later, depending on your monthly evaluation, this can be relaxed to 2 days per week. Why do we ask this? For learning opportunities, team discussion, and software architecture sessions.

### Who We're Looking For:
You are passionate about technology. You love learning and can quickly adapt. You have an affinity towards addressing challenges with innovative solutions and enjoy working with and growing together with a team. You want to play a pivotal role in the success of a young startup making an impact in healthcare, public transportation, governmental and other industries.

It would be great if you have experience with back-end development in Java and front-end experience in React. If not, your willingness to learn would suffice – we’ll teach you.

It is not imperative to have the experience. The motivation, drive, and passion to work with the technologies above would surely make you stand out. On top of that, we love problem solvers and team players with an interest in open-source software.

### Things We Value in Our Team:
- **Drive**: Strive for excellence. Go above and beyond to make a mark.
- **Openness**: Share ideas and feedback openly, honestly, and respectfully with the team, partners, and customers.
- **Accountability**: Deliver on promises.
- **User-centricity**: We prioritize the users of our product, focusing on their comfort and productivity.
- **Flexibility**: While our goals are ambitious, our approach remains flexible, evolving with our learnings.

### Interview Process:
- Technical interview with 3 Java exercises in your preferred IDE **at our offices, without an internet connection.**
- A conversation to gauge team fit.
