## Mission
This internship will allow the intern to work on a interesting optimization problem in the open-source world.

## Context
JobRunr is an [open-source](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr) cloud-native job scheduling tool that is downloaded 12.000 times / month and has processed over 9.5 billion jobs in only 8 months. It's a SDK (=jar) that can be downloaded from Maven Central and once added to a project it allows to create and schedule jobs using a simple API. These jobs are then distributed over multiple servers (e.g. Kubernetes, ...). Although it's open-source, it does not mean we're a small player: we're active in the medtech, transporation, crypto, warehousing, marketing and public governments and quite some Fortune top 100 are JobRunr users. **The world is managed by jobs** (cfr [Josh Long](https://twitter.com/starbuxman)) - let's make sure it's done well!

Typically, companies run their applications within docker containers hosted in Kubernetes on either Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform. Currently, they need to manually scale up their pods when a lot of jobs need to be processed and afterwards they again need to manually scale these pods down. The idea would be to automate this process.

## What we expect
The intern should be a master student motivated to work in the Java world and must have affinity with the open-source world and Kubernetes. He or she will have to understand the current software architecture of JobRunr and develop new functionalities on top of it. We expect a good understanding of computer science as a whole, but some basic competences are required for the task we propose:

- good experience with Java (or any other object oriented language)
- good experience with relational databases and NoSQL databases
- good experience with Kubernetes
- we will provide guidance but also expect you to sometimes work independently

## What we offer
A great working place, flexible hours and the possibility to put your stamp on an open-source project.
