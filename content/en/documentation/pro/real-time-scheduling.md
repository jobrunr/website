Do your jobs need to run some jobs on an exact moment? JobRunr Pro will do real-time enqueueing out-of-the-box!

### Some history

For performance reasons, JobRunr fetches all the jobs that need to be executed during the whole next `pollIntervalInSeconds`. This allows JobRunr to query, update and save jobs in bulk and that's the reason why scheduled and recurring jobs are sometimes performed a couple of seconds too early.

### JobRunr Pro to the rescue!

JobRunr Pro improves on this and:
- if the amount of jobs to schedule during the next `pollIntervalInSeconds` is less than 1000, it will automatically switch to real-time enqueueing with a __one-second precision__. This means if you have scheduled a job at 8pm, it will typically start processing within 50 milliseconds after 8pm.
- if the amount of jobs to schedule during the next `pollIntervalInSeconds` is more than 1000, JobRunr Pro will automatically fall back to near real-time enqueueing (so, a couple of seconds difference) again for the same performance reasons mentioned above.

> One-second precision means JobRunr Pro will group all the jobs that need to be scheduled in buckets per second and enqueue these jobs at that second. So, if there are 2 jobs that are scheduled at `2023-01-30T20:00:00.350` and `2023-01-30T20:00:00.550`, they will both be enqueued at `2023-01-30T20:00:00.000` (give or take a couple of milliseconds)
