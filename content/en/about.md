## JobRunr by [Ronald Dehuysser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronalddehuysser/)
On all the different projects where I joined teams as a freelance developer, coach and architect, I still see a lot of developers building the same thing over and over again - a way to do the CPU heavy work in the background so it does not block the REST Api.

Often, the code that was initially written as a PoC, is afterwards used in production but missed some important features like retries if a job fails, and monitoring was not implemented resulting in a lot of wasted time finding root causes for production bugs.

With JobRunr, I hope to solve all that.

## Eco-friendly software
<img src="/eco-friendly.webp" style="float: left; height: 140px; margin: 5px 20px 0 0"/>As I live by the mindset *__we only borrow the world from our children__*, I want to make sure that JobRunr is as eco-friendly as possible. That's why all the power that runs the build server is powered by my own PV installation and for each license JobRunr sells, I will make sure that some extra trees are planted via *[#teamtrees](https://teamtrees.org/)* in the hope to keep our planet as beautiful as it was when I entered on it. I challenge other companies to also spend 5% of their revenue to charitable causes.
