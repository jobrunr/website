### New license type
I'm happy to announce a [Startup license]({{< ref "/jobrunr-pro.md" >}}) which is priced at 500â‚¬ (excl. VAT). This license is tailored to freelancers and startups that want to use JobRunr for their projects.

### Celebration time!
And, I'm pleased to announce that the first license of JobRunr Pro was sold to [KomaK](https://www.komak.fr/) resulting in 25 trees being planted! A big thank you to KomaK for their trust and goooo [#teamtrees](https://teamtrees.org/search)!
