### Celebration time!
I'm pleased to announce the release of JobRunr v6.3.0 (which is now available via Maven Central) and JobRunr Pro v6.3.0 which is available for customers with a subscription. 

Since the 6.2.0 release, we did some **performance improvements related to the dashboard** resulting in less calls to the JobRunr rest API and we also did **stability improvements** which should result in less `SevereJobRunrExceptions`. This release adds support for **Micronaut 4** and **Kotlin 1.9**. 

In JobRunr Pro, we added **Observability** support, added the option to set a **`Job` time-out**, users can now **sort the jobs in the dashboard** and we improved the `RetryPolicy` which now also allows to specify a custom amount of retries per `Exception`.
And last but not least, all dependencies were also updated.

I also want to shoutout to [Sergi Almar](https://github.com/salmar) who improved the `spring-boot-starter` and [Geir Sagberg](https://github.com/geirsagberg) who fixed a bug in the dashboard for their contributions. You have my eternal üôè.


###### Observability
Although the JobRunr Pro Dashboard gives instant insights how your jobs are doing, you may already have an observability platform like [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), [HoneyComb](https://www.honeycomb.io) or [New Relic](https://newrelic.com) running inside your organization. JobRunr Pro now out-of-the box integrates with many of these observability platforms so you can keep on top of things. This means you can now see how long your different Job instances take and where a job spends the most time right from your existing observability platform.

###### Job Timeout
A `Job` time-out is exactly what you think it is - specify it when creating a `Job` and if the `Job` is processing longer than the given time-out, JobRunr will automatically interrupt it. 

## Improvements
