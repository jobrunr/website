At JobRunr, we build background job processing software with purpose. From day one, we’ve followed a simple principle: *leave the world better than we found it*.

We believe it’s our responsibility to give back — not just with our code, but through how we run our company.

## Why we do it 🌍

We live by the Boy Scout Rule: “Leave the campsite cleaner than you found it.” That mindset influences everything — from how we structure our codebase, to how we treat our customers, and how we give back to the planet.

Every JobRunr license, every feature we develop, every design choice — it’s all a chance to do things better and more responsibly.

## What We've Done So Far 🌱

Here are some of the ways we’ve already made a difference:

- **Planted over 15,000 trees** via <a href="https://teamtrees.org/search?q=jobrunr">#TeamTrees</a> — thanks to our JobRunr Pro customers 💚
- **100% solar-powered build servers**, running on PV panels installed at our founder’s home
- **5% of our yearly revenue** committed to environmental causes — that’s five times more than the standard for 1% for the Planet members


## What We’re Doing Next 🌿

### 💸 Going Beyond 1%

    JobRunr is part of <strong><a href="https://directories.onepercentfortheplanet.org/profile/rosoco-bv-jobrunr">1% for the Planet</a></strong> — but we don’t just donate and call it a day.
    We choose partners that align with our values and actually move the needle for the planet.

#### 🌊 River Cleanup
We love how [River Cleanup](https://www.river-cleanup.org/en) tackles plastic pollution head-on by involving communities, shifting mindsets, and driving structural change. Their mission to clean rivers before waste reaches the ocean felt like a no-brainer for us. It’s hands-on, measurable, and exactly the kind of focused impact we want to be part of.

#### 🌳 Treeapp
[Treeapp](https://www.thetreeapp.org/) stood out to us because they make reforestation scalable and smart. With transparency, local community involvement, and solid reporting, they help companies like us plant trees with real long-term impact. It’s not just about numbers — it’s about planting the right trees, in the right places, for the right reasons.

### 🌤️ Making Our Software Greener

We're also taking a closer look at how our code runs and how it can do less environmental harm. 

Our biggest update this year will be:
**[Carbon-aware scheduling](/en/blog/2024-03-21-carbon-aware-job-scheduling/)**: Running jobs when renewable energy is most available

### 🤝 Challenging Our Peers

We challenge other software companies to do the same. Whether it's 1% or 5%, every contribution makes a difference.

You don’t have to start big:
- Choose green hosting
- Offset your company emissions
- Make charitable giving a line item in your budget

## Our Promise 💚

This is core to how we operate JobRunr. We’ll keep planting trees. We’ll keep cleaning rivers. And we’ll keep writing efficient, low-impact software.

We’ll also keep sharing our journey — not to brag, but to inspire. Because if we can do this as a lean, developer-first company, others can too.
