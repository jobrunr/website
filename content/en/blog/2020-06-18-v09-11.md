I'm happy to announce that v0.9.11 of JobRunr, a distributed job scheduling library, is now available in Maven Central.

This is a small incremental release and JobRunr has now successfully been tested on both Quarkus and MicroProfile.

To make your life easier, I created two example repositories that show how you easily integrate it in your project. You can find these repositories here:

- Quarkus: https://github.com/jobrunr/example-quarkus
- MicroProfile: https://github.com/jobrunr/example-microprofile

I'm happy for any feedback on your experience with JobRunr and the source is off-course available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr).
