### Celebration time!
I'm pleased to announce the release of JobRunr v3.2.0 (which is now available via Maven Central) and JobRunr Pro v3.3.0 which is available for customers with a subscription.

### Some important improvements!
This release adds a lot of small, incremental improvements:
- Kotlin 1.5 support! Kotlin had a major release with 1.5 and I'm happy to say that JobRunr now also supports Kotlin 1.5.
- SQL Schema support! From now on, you can specify a table prefix which allows you to prefix each JobRunr table/index with a custom prefix (e.g. a schema). 

### Code Quality
As always, I strive for clean code when I'm working on JobRunr (or any other project). That's why this release got some extra love and fixes related to SonarQube.
