### Breaking changes
- `@Recurring` has been moved to core `org.jobrunr.jobs.annotations.Recurring` and uses enums instead of booleans. The attributes `paused` and `scheduleJobsSkippedDuringDowntime` now use an enum instead of a boolean. This allows us to keep the paused state of a Recurring job even if you redeploy (default) whereas in the past, on redeploy, the Job would be started automatically again. If `paused` is put to false in the `@Recurring`, the Recurring job will start on redeploy even if it was paused before via the dashboard
- `JobScheduler.delete(String id)` has been renamed to `JobScheduler.deleteRecurringJob(String id)`
- The `StorageProvider` has been updated and is not backwards compatible as is the `Page` and `PageRequest`.  A new class `org.jobrunr.storage.Paging` was added where all utility methods regarding Paging have been collected
- For SQL databases, JobRunr deletes all indexes and recreates them for better performance. If you have a lot of jobs in your database, the migration may take a while. Also, on some databases **column types are changed** for better performance making this release not backwards compatible.
- JobRunr and JobRunr Pro 7 requires MongoDB Driver 5.0.0 or higher (please be aware that Spring Boot 3.2 still depends on Mongo 4.x)
- **We're also dropping the `RedisStorageProvider` and the `ElasticSearchStorageProvider`** in JobRunr Pro. JobRunr 7 OSS will be the last to support it.
- `JobContext.getSignature()` has been renamed to `JobContext.getJobSignature()`
- `JobDashboardProgressBar.setValue(...)` has been renamed to `JobDashboardProgressBar.setProgress(long succeededAmount)`
- Overall `BatchJob`s logic has been rewritten, make sure `MigrateFromV6toV7Task` is run
- Dynamic queues configuration has been changed in Spring, Quarkus and Micronaut: `dynamic-queues.type` has been removed, instead the type is now part of the dynamic queues property keys, e.g., `org.jobrunr.jobs.dynamic-queue.round-robin.label-prefix` (please adapt to your framework)
