### Celebration time!
I'm pleased to announce the release of JobRunr v1.1.0. It is now available from download from Maven Central.

> This release contains some **breaking changes**: 
> - make sure to finish all scheduled and enqueued jobs and to also re-register your recurring jobs before upgrading.
> - the jobrunr-spring-boot-starter uses new properties that are more in line with Spring Boot. See the [Spring configuration]({{< ref "documentation/configuration/spring/_index.md" >}}) page for more info.

### New features
- __jobrunr-spring-boot-starter__: Thanks to the help of Spring Core Contributor [Stéphane Nicoll](https://github.com/snicoll), we now have improved support for the spring-boot-starter. You can enjoy autocomplete when defining the properties for the jobrunr-spring-boot-starter.
- __JobNotFoundNotifications__: When you start JobRunr, it will now display a warning in the logs and a notification in the Dashboard if there are scheduled jobs which do not exist anymore (e.g. due to a breaking change to your jobs). This allows you to fix these `JobNotFoundExceptions` fast instead of finding out later when the job fails.
- __Other notifications__: When a job succeeds, it will automatically go to the deleted state after 36 hours (this is off-course configurable). The dashboard (when viewing the job details) will now show a notification that the job will automatically go to the deleted state.

### Trivia
And to conclude, did you know that:
- JobRunr is now featured on [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-jobrunr-spring)?
- JobRunr received contributions from a Spring Boot Core Member?
- JobRunr received contributions from an Uber engineer?
- JobRunr almost has [200 Github stars](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/stargazers)?
- I will soon add a cheaper license for startups and freelancers?
- I have my first inquiry for a JobRunr Pro license?
