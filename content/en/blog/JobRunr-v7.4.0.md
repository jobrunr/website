# Introducing JobRunr v7.4.0 and JobRunr Pro v7.4.0

We‚Äôre excited to share that JobRunr v7.4.0 and JobRunr Pro v7.4.0 are now available! 
These new versions are built to make your Java background job scheduling even smoother and more efficient.

## üåü **Notable Highlights**


**Compatibility updates**

- **Support for JDK 24:** Future-proof your applications with support for the latest Java version.
- **Spring Boot 3.4 Compatibility:** Enjoy seamless integration with the newest Spring Boot framework, ensuring smoother workflows.
- **Kotlin 2.1 Support:** Stay current with the latest Kotlin improvements, enhancing productivity and sustainability.
- **Dropped Kotlin 1.8 Support:** Focus on cutting-edge features by retiring older dependencies.
- **Elasticsearch Java API Client v8.15+ Required:** If you‚Äôre using ElasticStorageProvider, upgrade to the latest Elasticsearch client to access new API features.

‚ö†Ô∏è¬†We needed to cleanup SQL migration files. This change is mostly inconsequential but¬†**if your migrations are managed by tools like Flyway, you may need to intervene**¬†and manually update the checksum of the changed files.

## üõ† **Enhancements**
