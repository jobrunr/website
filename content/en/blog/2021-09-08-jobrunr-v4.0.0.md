### Celebration time!
I'm pleased to announce the release of JobRunr v4.0.0 (which is now available via Maven Central) and JobRunr Pro v4.0.0 which is available for customers with a subscription. As this is a major release, there are also some small breaking changes.

### Some great new features to both JobRunr and JobRunr Pro!
###### New features in JobRunr
This release adds a ton of new improvements to JobRunr:
- __Job Analysis Performance mode__: when a job is analyzed for the first time, JobRunr checks whether it can be cached. If so, all subsequent calls will be a lot faster. If job is not cacheable this is displayed in the dashboard.
- __JobRequest and JobRequestHandler__: this release introduces the `JobRequest` and `JobRequesthandler`. This is a new way to create jobs using the command / commandhandler pattern (meaning you can use objects instead of lambdas to create background jobs). [Read all about it]({{< ref "../documentation/background-methods/_index.md#via-a-jobrequest" >}}) in the updated documentation section.
- __Static method support__: JobRunr can now create jobs using lambdas referencing static methods. 
- Updated __JobRunr Spring Boot Starter__ with:
  - Support for `@Recurring` annotation for Recurring jobs
  - Support for disabled Recurring jobs using "-"
  - Support for multiple datasources in Spring (a specific datasource for JobRunr)
  - Support for Spring Actuator Health Endpoint
  - Support for Spring Actuator Metrics Endpoint
- New __Micronaut Integration__ with:
  - Support for `@Recurring` annotation for Recurring jobs
  - Support for disabled Recurring jobs using "-"
  - Support for multiple datasources in Micronaut (a specific datasource for JobRunr)
  - Support for Micronaut Health Endpoint
  - Support for Micronaut Metrics Endpoint
- New __Quarkus Extension__ with:
  - Support for `@Recurring` annotation for Recurring jobs
  - Support for disabled Recurring jobs using "-"
  - Support for multiple datasources in Quarkus (a specific datasource for JobRunr)
  - Support for Quarkus Health Endpoint
  - Support for Quarkus Metrics Endpoint
- __CPU Allocation Irregularities detection__: as JobRunr uses NTP (network time protocol) and timeouts to detect if a `BackgroundJobServer` is still alive, it is important that the JVM does not stop too long. JVM's can stop due to full garbage collection taking too long or if they are running on shared cloud hardware where resources are stealed by other processes. JobRunr now detects this and shows a warning in the dashboard as it can impact the cluster.


###### New features in JobRunr Pro
JobRunr Pro also received a lot of new features!
- __Pause Recurring Jobs:__ you can now pause recurring jobs with a click from the dashboard. Later on, you can easily resume these recurring jobs.
- __Job Migrations:__ on start, JobRunr Pro checks if there are jobs that cannot be found anymore. If there are jobs that do not exist anymore in the current version of your application, you can choose to delete them or even update them (this comes in handy when you have a lot of scheduled jobs in the future that you can now easily migrate!). [Read more]({{< ref "../documentation/pro/migrations.md" >}}) about it in the documentation.
- __Database fault-tolerance:__ JobRunr by default stops processing jobs if the connection to the database is lost (see also [why this happens in the FAQ]({{< ref "../documentation/faq.md#jobrunr-stops-completely-if-my-sql--nosql-database-goes-down" >}})). JobRunr Pro now is now fault-tolerant in this regard and automatically starts processing again the moment your database is back online.

### Breaking changes:
- the enum `DatabaseOptions` moved to StorageProviderUtils. You will need to adapt your import.
- the `pollIntervalInSeconds` can not be smaller than 5 or else an exception will be thrown. This is to not generate too much load on your SQL or noSQL database (and I think 5 seconds is even too low to be honest)
- StateChanges are now validated: this will impact people who are using `ElectStateFilters` and are changing states that are not valid (e.g. from `FAILED` to `SUCCEEDED`, from `PROCESSING` to `PROCESSING`). Make sure to (unit) test these `ElectStateFilters` against the latest `Job` class.
- `JobRunr.configure()....initialize()` now returns a `JobRunrConfigurationResult` which contains the `JobScheduler` and the `JobRequestScheduler`. This is done to add support for scheduling jobs via Java 8 lambdas and via the `JobRequest` interface.
- `BackgroundJobServerConfiguration andWorkerCountPolicy(BackgroundJobServerWorkerPolicy backgroundJobServerWorkerPolicy)` has been renamed to `BackgroundJobServerConfiguration andBackgroundJobServerWorkerPolicy(BackgroundJobServerWorkerPolicy backgroundJobServerWorkerPolicy)`
- the `JobContext.getMetadata()` method now returns an unmodifiable Map. To add metadata, you should now use the `JobContext.saveMetadata(String, Object)` method

### Code Quality
As always, I strive for clean code when I'm working on JobRunr (or any other project). That's why this release got some extra love and fixes related to SonarQube.
