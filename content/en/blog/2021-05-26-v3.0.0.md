### Celebration time!
I'm pleased to announce the release of JobRunr v3.0.0. It is now available for download from Maven Central.

### Breaking changes ahead!
There is a __really small breaking change__ in this release if you are using the Fluent API - this to ensure that some new and exciting features can easily be implemented in [JobRunr Pro]({{<ref "/documentation/pro/_index.md">}}). That is also the reason why this release is a major release.

This means you will need to do the following changes:

<h6>Configuration using Fluent API in v1.x.x & 2.x.x:</h6>
<figure style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%">

```java
JobRunr
  .configure()
  ...
  .useDefaultBackgroundJobServer(usingStandardBackgroundJobServerConfiguration().andWorkerCount(5))
  ....;
```
</figure>

<h6>Configuration using Fluent API in v3.x.x:</h6>
<figure style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%">

```java
JobRunr
  .configure()
  ...
  .useBackgroundJobServer(usingStandardBackgroundJobServerConfiguration().andWorkerCount(5))
  ....;
```
</figure>

Some methods related to this were also dropped.

> If you are using the `jobrunr-spring-boot-starter` integration, you should not be impacted by these changes.

### New features
JobRunr now integrates by default with [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/).

### Bugfixes
- [Github issue 122](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/122): ConcurrentJobModificationException due to master tasks taking too long
- [Github issue 128](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/128): SqlStorageProvider assumes that all DataSources are autoCommit enabled


### Special thanks to ...
[Pei-Tang Huang](https://github.com/tan9) who informed me of a bug when using JobRunr in a JHipster environment because of JobRunr not committing. Not only did he inform me of the bug, he also created a Pull Request that fixed it 👏!
