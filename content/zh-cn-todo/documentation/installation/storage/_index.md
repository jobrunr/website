JobRunr stores the job details for each job using a `StorageProvider` and supports all major SQL databases and NoSQL databases.

> __Important__: you will need to add the correct dependency (jdbc-driver) for each of the databases below.

## SQL databases
By default, JobRunr will automatically create the necessary tables for your database. If however you do not want to give the JobRunr DataSource DDL rights, you can easily create the tables JobRunr uses yourself using one of the following methods:

#### Run the DatabaseCreator
The DatabaseCreator class allows you to create the necessary tables using a terminal. You must provide a user which has DDL rights.

```
java -cp jobrunr-${jobrunr.version}.jar org.jobrunr.storage.sql.common.DatabaseCreator {jdbcUrl} {userName} {password}
```

If the command succeeds, a confirmation message will be shown.

#### Apply the SQL scripts yourself
- __Oracle__ - apply all the sql scripts found [here](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/tree/master/core/src/main/resources/org/jobrunr/storage/sql/oracle/migrations).
- __Postgres__ - apply all the sql scripts found [here](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/tree/master/core/src/main/resources/org/jobrunr/storage/sql/common/migrations).
- __MySql__ - apply all the sql scripts found [here](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/tree/master/core/src/main/resources/org/jobrunr/storage/sql/common/migrations) overriding some of these sql scripts with the MySql specific scripts found [here](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/tree/master/core/src/main/resources/org/jobrunr/storage/sql/mariadb/migrations).
- __MariaDB__ - apply all the sql scripts found [here](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/tree/master/core/src/main/resources/org/jobrunr/storage/sql/common/migrations) overriding some of these sql scripts with the MariaDB specific scripts found [here](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/tree/master/core/src/main/resources/org/jobrunr/storage/sql/mariadb/migrations).
- __DB2__ - apply all the sql scripts found [here](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/tree/master/core/src/main/resources/org/jobrunr/storage/sql/db2/migrations).

Once you created the tables, you must configure JobRunr as follows:

```java
JobRunr.configure()
    .useStorageProvider(new DefaultSqlStorageProvider(dataSource, DatabaseOptions.SKIP_CREATE))
    .useBackgroundJobServer()
    .initialize();
```


## NoSQL databases
- __MongoDB__ - JobRunr will create the necessary collection to save all Jobs and Recurring Jobs automatically for you
- __InMemory__ - JobRunr comes with an InMemoryStorageProvider, which is ideal for lightweight tasks that are server-instance specific and where persistence is not important. Note that if you use the `InMemoryStorageProvider`, you can not scale horizontally as the storage is not shared.
